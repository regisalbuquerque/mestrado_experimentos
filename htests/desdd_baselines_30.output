The Chi-Square statistics is 6.43.
The critical value of the Chi-square statistics with 3 degrees of freedom and at 95 percentile is 7.81
According to the Freidman test using the Chi-Square statistics, the null-hypothesis that all algorithms behave similar should not be rejected

The critical value of the Chi-square statistics with 3 degrees of freedom and at 90 percentile is 6.25
According to the Freidman test using the Chi-Square statistics, the null-hypothesis that all algorithms behave similar should be rejected

The F-statistics is 2.35.

Running the Nemenyi post-hoc test to verify wheter it is possible to detect differences among algorithms.

According to the the Nemenyi statistis, the critical value for comparing the mean-ranking of two different algorithms at 95 percentile is 1.25. Mean-rankings differences above this value are significative.

Algorithms which performed better are marked as +++, worst as ---, and where it is not possible to detect difference is marked as ooo.
